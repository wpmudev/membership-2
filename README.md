Welcome to M2! It's the new, improved version of our Membership and Protected Content plugins, and it's the best version yet.

### To Install:

Installing M2 will depend on where you're starting from, so this part of this guide is divided into three sections; Upgrading from Protected Content, Upgrading from Membership, and First-time install. Read the section that pertains to you before you jump in.

##### Upgrading from Protected Content

Upgrading to M2 from Protected Content is the simplest option. M2 will show in your admin as an available update for Protected Content, which means it will quietly replace Protected Content when the upgrade is complete. Congrats! You're done!

##### Upgrading from Membership

Important Note: You **must** upgrade from your WPMU DEV Dashboard, rather than via FTP or Plugins > Add New > Upload in order to import your Membership settings to M2. 1: Make sure the latest version of the [WPMU DEV Dashboard](https://premium.wpmudev.org/project/dashboard/ "The Dashboard") is installed. 2: Make sure latest version of the old Membership plugin is installed (3.5.3.3). 3: You'll see a button to unlock the update under **Membership2 > Settings** and/or **WPMU DEV > Updates**. 4: If you don't, you can click the link in your WPMU DEV Dashboard to force it to check for updates and repeat step 3. Once M2 is active, go to Membership2 > Settings > Import tool. You'll see two radio buttons, one to import via file, one to import WPMU DEV Membership settings. You'll chose the second button, then Preview Import. Once you're satisfied with how things will import, hit import. M2 will import membership levels, subscription information/data, and member data from Membership. However, M2 will not import shortcodes or content protection settings. So after upgrading, you will need to add in all your content protection settings for each membership level, and find and replace any Membership-generated shortcodes with M2 shortcodes. Tip: use a handy plugin like [_Better Search Replace_](https://wordpress.org/plugins/better-search-replace//) to make that more of a cheer than a chore. _Important:_ In some cases, WordPress cannot replace the plugin files automatically and will display an error during update. When this happens, please deactivate and delete the old Membership plugin before installing Membership 2 Pro. Congrats! After this, you're done too!

##### First-time install

If you've never used Protected Content or Membership before, you'll install the plugin just as you would any other. You can visit the [Installing Plugins](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wpmu-manual/installing-regular-plugins-on-wpmu/) section in our comprehensive [WordPress and WordPress Multisite Manual](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wpmu-manual/) if you are new to WordPress. Congrats! You're ready to set up M2.

### Creating a Membership Site with M2

If you've already used Membership or Protected Content, using M2 is going to be very familiar to you. M2 allows you to control, down to the tiniest detail, what content you show to which members. With free and paid membership options, you can choose to protect content behind a paywall, or just create a private space for your free members. Let's start building your site now.

##### Step One: Make a Plan

Creating a content protection plan is your first step. Jot down a diagram or outline of how you want your site to work. What membership levels do you want? What content do you want users on each membership to see or not see? Do you want your content to be always protected on some memberships, yet made accessible on others over time or on specific dates? If you'll charge for access, how much will it cost and how will you accept payments? Yep, M2 can handle all that & more!  

![image](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/m2-make-plan-1x.png)

 Start with a plan for your content protection.

    If you have installed M2 or upgraded to it on a multisite network, part of your plan should be to decide whether you want your content protection rules to apply site-by-site, or if you want to leverage the network-wide protection features of M2. If content should be protected site-by-site, simply activate the plugin on the site where you want your content protected and continue with the setup as detailed in the rest of this guide. But, if you want to create content protection rules network-wide, you'll need to first add the following constant to your wp-config.php file: `define( 'MS_PROTECT_NETWORK', true );` You can then set up protection rules from your network admin for every site in your network. Woot! **Important note:** the above constant will only work if added to wp-config.php _before_ you start creating your memberships. Any existing memberships on any site in your network will _not_ be recognized by the network settings. A future release of M2 will allow for pre-existing memberships to also function network-wide. When you've got a rough sketch of your plan, it's time to start building your content protection.

##### Step Two: Create Memberships

If you are not redirected immediately to the **Setup** page after installing the plugin, click the **Setup** menu item in the **Membership2** menu.  

![Membership2 Setup](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/m2-1011-setup.png)

  Memberships are the heart of M2, and you'll use the memberships you create to complete each additional step in the set up process. To start, we give you a default "System Membership." All current members will be in this Membership until they choose or they are moved to a different plan. With M2, you can create four different types of Membership.  

![M2 Memberships Create New](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/m2-1000-memberships-create-new1.png)

  _1\. Standard Membership:_ Most typical memberships will be Standard. Standard memberships can be free or paid. You can create as many standard memberships as you'd like. If you want to created a tiered system, such as Bronze, Silver, and Gold plans, you'll create a standard membership for each tier you want to offer. _2\. Guest Membership:_ A guest membership sets rules for non-logged in visitors to your site. If you'd like visitors to have unique access rules, you'll need a Guest Membership. You'll only be allowed to create one guest membership which will apply to all guests. _3\. Dripped Membership:_ This membership is used when you have content you want to grant access to one piece/group at a time. The settings for this membership will allow you to set dates or time spans for when content is to be revealed or hidden. _4\. Default Membership:_ This is similar to the System Membership that is added by default. It's a membership for any registered/logged in user that is not currently the member of any other membership plan. Like the guest membership, there can only be one default membership on your site. Creating a new membership is very simple. 1\. Go to **Membership2 > Memberships** 2\. Click "Create New Membership" 3\. Choose the type of membership from the grid of four. 4\. Name your membership. 5\. Save. Create each of the memberships you'll need (you can add/edit/remove them later, as well) and we'll move on to the next step. Don't worry about setting up billing or payment gateways at this time, we'll add those later on.

##### Step Three: M2 Pages

Next up, a quick and easy step; setting up the necessary pages M2 will need. Go to **Membership2 > Settings > General**  

![M2 Protect Content Settings](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/m2-1000-protect-content-settings.png)

 

1.  Make sure you have a Memberships, Register, Account, Protected Content, and Registration Complete page set up for M2.
2.  Decide which items you want to appear in your main navigation menu.
3.  Decide whether you want the black admin bar that will usually show on the top of each page on your site (the one that says "Howdy, you") to show for members. You'll likely want to wait until you've finished getting everything set up before clicking the Content Protection toggle though.

**Important notes:**

*   If you're using a plugin to create a custom registration page, like BuddyPress, Pie Register, or Gravity Forms, be sure to select THAT registration page here, rather than the default one created by the Membership2 plugin.
*   If you are using another plugin for registration, be sure to add the following code to your theme's _functions.php_ file so the Membership2 plugin knows about it (this is not required for BuddyPress, but it won't interfere if you add it anyway): `add_filter('ms_frontend_handle_registration', '__return_false');`

##### Step Four: Content Protection

**Membership 2 > Protection Rules** is your home base for choosing who sees what content, all in one beautiful and easy to use page. You'll see your content protection options in a vertical list of tabs. Clicking any of these tabs will allow you to set content protection for that particular content type.  

![M2 Page Protection Settings](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/M2_PageProtection.png)

 M2 Page Protection Settings

   

![M2 Comment & More Tag Protection](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/M2_CommentsMoreTagProtection.png)

 M2 Comment & More Tag Protection

  With no Add-Ons active, M2 allows you to protect pages, custom post types, comments and the "more" tag (see below for more about the available Add-Ons). It also provides settings for basic menu item protection.  

![M2 Menu Protection](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/M2_MenuProtection-700x838.png)

 M2 Menu Protection

  You'll see the default mode is for everyone to be able to see everything. If you hover over any content item's current access, you'll see a "modify access link." Click this to restrict this content item to only members of the membership(s) you assign. A colorful pop up will appear with each of your memberships listed. Click the memberships you want, and move through the content items, and tabs, one by one until you're satisfied with your settings.

##### Step Five: Billing, Subscriptions, and Payment, Oh My!

M2 comes packed with several payment gateway options. Authorize.net Manual payments PayPal Single PayPal Standard Stripe Single Stripe Subscriptions  

![M2 Payment Gateways](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/M2_PaymentGateways.png)

  You can choose whichever gateway or combination of gateways meets the needs of your an your members. You can set up your supported gateways via **Membership2 > Settings > Payments**. When payment gateways are set up, go back to **Membership2 > Memberships**, and edit each paid membership to include the gateway, the cost, and the duration of the membership.  

![Hover to see the Payment Options link.](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/M2_MembershipPaymentSettings.png)

 Hover to see the Payment Options link.

   

![M2 Subscription Payment Options](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/M2_IndividualMembershipPaymentSettings.png)

 M2 Subscription Payment Options

  If you're planning on accepting recurring subscription payments, you'll need to use either PayPal Standard or Stripe Subscriptions to manage the payments. Now that your memberships, content protection, and payment information are all in place, all that's left is adding a few more personal details and checking your levels to ensure everything is working as expected.

##### Step Six: Final Steps & Pulling it All Together

You'll notice there are still a few more settings in M2 you can adjust. Let's take a quick look. Protected Content Messages - You can change the text (and even add images and fancy styling!) when a user is trying to view content they don't have access to. You'll find these messages in **Membership2 > Settings > Protection Messages**. M2 also comes with a very handy "Membership Simulator" tool that allows you to view your site as if you were a member of any (or none) of your Memberships. Before you call it a day, take a few minutes and run through each of your Memberships to make sure they see what you want them to see. To access the Simulator, click the **Test Memberships** button in the toolbar in your admin or on the frontend of your site. You'll then see the Simulator window in the top-right corner on every page of your site.  

![M2 Membership Simulator](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/m2-1000-membership-simulator.png)

  Reward yourself with a pat on the back, you're getting there!

### Membership2 Add-Ons

The real magic in Membership2 is in the Add Ons. All the Add-Ons are included, but only those that apply to your individual set-up can be enabled so you don't need to deal with any items you don't need. For example, if you do not have BuddyPress installed on your site, that Add-On will be greyed out with a message informing you that BuddyPress needs to activated before you can use it.  

![M2 Add Ons](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/M2_AddOns.png)

    The following Add-Ons are included: _Additional Automated Messages_ - this add on allows you create custom auto-messages for members.

 M2 Category Protection

![M2 Add New Coupon Settings](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/M2_AddCoupon.png)

 M2 Add New Coupon Settings

    _Individual Custom Posts_ - If you'd like to control access to custom posts on a post-by-post basis, this add on will help.

 M2 Custom Post Type Items Protection

  _Individual Posts_ - Like the add on above, but for standard WordPress blog posts. When enaled, this Add-On will add a new tab under **Membership 2 > Protection Rules** called _Posts_ where you can protect individual posts.  

![M2 Post Protection](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/m2-1000-post-protection.png)

 M2 Post Protection

  _Mail Chimp Integration_ - If you're a MailChimp user, this add on allows you to automatically optin your users to your MailChimp lists.

 M2 Media Protection Options

  _Member Capabilities_ - This add on will allow you to grant permissions/access for individual members, outside of their membership level.  

![M2 Advanced Capabilities](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/M2_Capabilities.png)

 M2 Advanced Capabilities

  _Multiple Memberships_ - If you need users to have more than one simultaneous membership on your site, this add on will allow that functionality. This Add-On doesn't create any new settings for you to worry about though. **Important note:** Members who are in multiple membership levels will default to the permissions of the most permissive level they belong to, if there's a conflict. For example, let's say you have a craft-based site where members can join any memberships they want, and each membership is based on a craft. If the Knitters have access to all custom post types, but Stitchers do not, and Bev is a member of both Knitters and Stitchers, Bev will have access to all custom post types. _Protect Special Pages_ - Special page protection covers archives, 404 Pages, and search result pages, to provide truly wall-to-wall protection for your site.  

![M2 Special Pages Protection](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/m2-1000-special-pages-protection.png)

 M2 Special Pages Protection

  _Redirect Control_ - If you want to control where users are redirected after logging in or logging out, this add on will be a big help. A future update will include the ability to set custom redirects based on memberships.

  _Shortcode Protection_ - This Add-On will enable you to protect the content that is output by shortcodes from WordPress, or even other plugins. Booya!  

![M2 Shortcode Protection](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/m2-1000-shortcode-protection.png)

 M2 Shortcode Protection

  _Taxamo_ - EU VAT regulations apply to you? We've got your back. This Add-On will add a new tab to Membership2 > Settings where you can set up your Taxamo stuff.  

![M2 Taxamo Settings](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/m2-1000-taxamo-settings.png)

 M2 Taxamo Settings

  _Trial Period_ - If you'd like to give potential paying members a free taste of how great a membership on your site can be, activate the Trial Period add on. A new option will become available in the Payment settings for each paid membership you have.  

![M2 Trial Period](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/m2-1000-trial-period.png)

 M2 Trial Period

  _URL Protection_ - When none of the other add ons will do, URL protection will allow you to protect content by the page URL. URL protection includes regular expression support, so you can drill down into specific content as much as you need. Be careful with this one though; any rules you add here will override all other rules.  

![M2 URL Restrictions](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/m2-1000-url-restrictions.png)
